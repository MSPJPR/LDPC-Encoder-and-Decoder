Project Title:

LDPC Encoder and Decoder with Noise Simulation


---

Description:

This project is a web application that demonstrates the process of encoding, simulating noise, and decoding binary data using Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. LDPC codes are powerful error-correcting codes used in communication systems to ensure data integrity over noisy channels.


---

Features:

1. Binary Data Input:
Users can enter a string of binary data (0s and 1s).


2. LDPC Encoding:
The input data is encoded using a simple LDPC encoding mechanism (parity-check method).


3. Noise Simulation:
Users can specify an error rate (percentage) to simulate noise by flipping bits randomly in the encoded data.


4. LDPC Decoding:
The application attempts to decode the noisy data back to its original form.


5. Dark Mode Toggle:
A dark mode feature allows users to switch between light and dark themes for better visual comfort.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structure of the web application.

CSS: Styling and responsive design, including light/dark themes.

JavaScript: Core logic for LDPC encoding, noise simulation, and decoding.



---

File Structure:

1. index.html: The main HTML file providing the user interface.


2. style.css: The CSS file for styling the webpage and enabling responsive design.


3. script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for encoding, noise simulation, and decoding.




---

How It Works:

1. User Input: The user enters binary data in the input field.


2. Encoding: When the "Encode" button is clicked, the binary data is encoded using a simple LDPC-like encoding method.


3. Noise Simulation: The user specifies an error rate and clicks "Simulate Noise" to introduce random bit flips.


4. Decoding: Clicking the "Decode" button attempts to correct the errors and recover the original data.


5. Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.

This project is a practical demonstration of information coding theory concepts and can be further expanded to surprise and impress professors with advanced features and real-world applicability.
